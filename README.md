Mathematical Theory Behind The Origami

This repository is my term project of the course Computational Complexity, which is a literature review on complexity of origami. Origami is one of my hobbies since high school. I am interested in the mathematical theory behind the design priciples of origami all the time. 

The project mainly concentrates on the flat foldability, which is about determining crease directions of creases in one crease pattern, and one of design methods ---- Circle Packing Method, or Tree Method, which is a very powerful design method that can achieve all kinds of complex models. 

Final_Report.pdf is my final paper and Representation.pdf is my representation PPT on the class.
